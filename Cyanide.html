									<h1>3lb Combat Robot: Cyanide</h1>
									<p>This is my second real combat robot that I designed after Applesauce. The name comes from
										the idea that theres a lot of cyanide inside of apple seeds.
									</p>

								<p>This is Cyanide version 1. This robot had a lot of weight issues and was not built optimally. I had to 
									cut the wheels in half to save weight, and it ended up not working out very well. This robot used the same weapon 
									system as Applesauce, but I didn't really design the robot optimally, so it was very front heavy, which made it awful to drive 
									in its vertical configuration, as it would lurch forward when I would try to drive.

								  <p>This is Cyanide V2, it fared a little better than Cyanide V1 and looks a lot sleeker. It had less drive issues due to having 
									a better center of mass. It ended up having quite a few weapon issues however, due to suboptimal belt tensioning, and still using an outdated 
									weapon system of a belt and 3D printed pulley, and using an old discontinued motor.
								</p>

								<p>After all the issues with weapon consistency, for Cyanide V3, I opted to build my own hub motor, I designed, did the CAM, and machined this housing 
									for a motor, on which the weapon will sit on top of.

								  <div>Cyanide V3 has done the best out of all versions and competed at MASSD. It won its first match then took irrepairable damage later on.
									 This robot did have a few issues, as the gears it used to pivot it's head stripped after a few matches, and I was forced into its horizontal 
									 configuration for the rest of the day. Next time I plan to machine the gears out of aluminum and broach the gear that sits on the servo.
