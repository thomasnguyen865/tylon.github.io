									<h1>UF-WHOA</h1>
									<p>UF-WHOA is the product that I made alongside my team while taking MIT's 2.00b Class during my freshman year.
									The team was made of up six students, and each student ended up working on a different subsystem</p>

								<div class="image main"><img src="images/2.00b/image0.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>My main role in the team was as the electronics expert. At the time, I had the most experience with Arduino, so I programmed most of the game
									and did almost all of the electronics. The electronics consist of an Arduino Nano, an Arduino Uno, a DFplayer module, an audio amplifier, a MPU6050 accelerometer,
									6 switches, and an LED light strip. The entire thing ran off of a 9V battery, which ended up causing some issues later on.
									The Arduino UNO wasn't really necessary, and was only used because the voltage regulator on the Nano fried at some point and we needed a replacement immediately.
								</p>
								<p>I programmed the game to be like Simon, but there was a little bit of a twist to it, literally. Two lights would turn on on the edges and 
									a player can pick either one to step on. When they step on one, there is a little beep and they go onto the next one. Part of the randomization includes
									 a twist element, where the entire ring would light up purple and the player would have to twist their body to move onto the next button.
									 The code for all of this ended up being decently long, especially with the LED elements and the timing.
