									<h1>About Me</h1>
									<p>I am a MIT class of 2026, and I went to Lyman High School in Florida.<br />
									I like designing things and being able to bring the things I make to life.<br />
									I often end up taking classes that directly align with the current project<br />
									that I'm working on. <br />
									</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/aboutme.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>I am passionate about robotics and all the things that robots require, including electronics, programming, their physical design, etc. The personal projects that I do are done
									simply because I think they are interesting and I want to see if I can. Throughout my journeys I often learn new skills that I can apply to future projects.
								</p>
								<p>I also really love to teach! I've done some teaching programs at MIT, including the Splash and Sprk teaching programs, as well as having done GTL Korea twice now.
									In the Splash and Sprk programs I mostly taught fun things. During the GTL Korea program, the first time around I taught Korean students Mechanical Engineering and design
									following MIT's Mens et Manus philosophy. The second time around I taught electrical engineering and with the same philosophy. 
								</p>
								<p>In my free time, I like to edit videos to put on youtube. Sometimes I play video games, mostly Slay the Spire or Balatro.
