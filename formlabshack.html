									<h1>Air Compressor Nerf Gun</h1>
									<p>I worked with a partner to design and fabricate an air compressor nerf gun. 
									</p>

								<p>Originally 
									the design was to be an axial air compressor, but we ended up doing a hand crank air pump.
									 Most of the parts were printed at Formlabs on their Form 4 printers using Tough 2000 resin.
									  I designed the majority of the nerf gun and Luke ended up fabricating most of it since I had commitments on the
									  Saturday of the hackathon, and on Saturday night we would meet back up to fix whatever was wrong.
									   Surprisingly the Saturday night redesign worked flawlessly on Sunday, where if it failed we wouldn't have time to redesign
										and reprint.</p>

								<p>This is the initial math that we did at the hackathon, we ended up going back to it later and realized that we 
									were a little off with the force calculations, and that we would need about 230N of force rather than 1000N of force for the pump.
									 The pressure calculations ended up being fine however. 
									 The air compressor part of the nerf gun used two check valves and a piston to pressure the pressure vessel. These things were printed from 
									 Tough 2000 resin, which we were pleasantly surprised to see held up very well.
